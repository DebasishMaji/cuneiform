htcondorcre
===========

The HTCondorCre extends the [Cuneiform](https://github.com/joergen7/cuneiform) functional language to run on HTCondor Servers (http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/). Cuneiform is a workflow specification language which makes it easy to integrate heterogeneous tools and libraries and exploit data parallelism. This extension creates another execution enviroment for the language, beside [Hi-WAY](https://github.com/marcbux/Hi-WAY), wich is used to run Cuneiform on Hadoop YARN.


#Attention

The code is under active developement and not executable yet. It still lacks the ability to check the status of the job after it has been submitted to HTCondor and will not recieve the output files.
