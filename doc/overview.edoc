@title Cuneiform documentation
@doc This is the Erlang implementation of the Cuneiform workflow language.
It supports execution on multiple platforms, see {@link local} for a single node execution mode and {@link htcondor} for a distributed environment. Other platforms can be added by implementing the callback functions of {@link cf_cre}, the cuneiform runtime environment.
The {@link cuneiform_app} uses the supervisor {@link cf_sup} as main process, which starts the chosen runtime environment (based on the command line arguments, see {@link cuneiform}). It also starts a log manager {@link logmgr}, which supports remote logging for a monitoring the progress and state of the workflow.
